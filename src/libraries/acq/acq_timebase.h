 * @brief    AcqTimebase: sample-exact relation between streams that share a hardware clock (clock domain).
 *
 * AcqClockModel relates a stream to host time with microsecond-class uncertainty; enough for markers
 * across devices, not for MR (RF transmit, T/R switch, gradients, receive) or closed-loop stimulation,
 * which must line up to the sample. Streams whose sample clocks derive from one oscillator form a clock
 * domain: every stream has an integer number of domain ticks per sample and an origin tick, so mapping
 * between them is integer arithmetic without host time and without drift.
 *
 * Domains follow the hardware, as on Spectrum cards, where every timing quantity is an integer number
 * of clock cycles in a fixed step (sample rates from a PLL or clock divider of one reference; trigger
 * delay, gate length, pre/post trigger and pulse generator periods in steps of N samples):
 * - The domain tick is the common clock all sample clocks are integer divisions of (e.g. the 10 MHz
 *   reference multiplied by the PLL; for an 80 MS/s ADC and a 1.25 GS/s DAC, 10 GHz: 125 and 8 ticks).
 * - The origin tick is the domain tick at which sample 0 crosses the connector, so known converter and
 *   trigger latencies are part of it.
 * - sampleAlignment is the step in which a stream can place things (Spectrum SPC_GATE_LEN_ALIGNMENT,
 *   SPC_TRIG_AVAILDELAY_STEP, ...). Exact mapping only succeeds on that grid; an off-grid instant is a
 *   configuration error reported as NotOnGrid, not hidden by interpolation.
 *
 * Domain membership (who shares a clock):
 * - One device: all its streams are one domain, named by the backend "scheme:serial"; FrequencyLocked
 *   from opening, PhaseLocked once the backend knows the per-stream latencies.
 * - Devices synchronised by hardware the backend can query (Spectrum star-hub): the hub's domain,
 *   PhaseLocked by the common start.
 * - Devices wired by hand (clock output of one card into the external clock input of another, a shared
 *   10 MHz reference, an amplifier clocked from the stimulator): the user declares it with the URI
 *   parameter clock_from=ID (the device id of the clock master), or clock_domain=NAME for an external reference
 *   that is not itself a device. The declaration only yields Declared; verify() promotes it to PhaseLocked
 *   after loop-back sync markers have shown zero drift, so a wiring mistake can never produce a wrong
 *   sample.
 * - Everything else: domain 0 (Free); only AcqClockModel relations apply. No configuration for EEG users.
 *
 * Sample-exact playout of an RF pulse 2 ms after an event detected in a receive stream:
 * @code
 * const ACQLIB::AcqTimebase& rxTb = view.timebase();                // from the input view
 * const ACQLIB::AcqTimebase txTb = tx.timebase();                    // output stream of the same domain
 * const auto twoMs = static_cast<std::int64_t>(rxTb.ticksPerSecond / 500);
 * auto at = ACQLIB::mapSampleExact(rxTb, txTb, eventSample, twoMs, ACQLIB::AcqRounding::Exact);
 * if (at && *at >= writer.earliestWritableSample()) {
 *     auto out = writer.beginWriteAt(*at, pulseSamples, std::chrono::microseconds(200));
 *     // encode the pulse and the T/R switch bit into *out, then writer.commit(pulseSamples)
 * }
 * @endcode

 * @brief    AcqRecorder: records any stream to FIFF (optionally as BIDS) while it is acquired.
 *
 * The recorder consumes the stream through its own Lossless reader, so it never slows the producer; if the
 * disk cannot keep up, the reader loses samples instead and the recorder writes them as zeros under a
 * BAD_ACQ_SKIP annotation, which keeps the file's sample axis that of the stream.
 *
 * Samples keep their native format: int16 is stored as FIFFT_DAU_PACK16, packed int24 and int32 as FIFFT_INT,
 * float32 as FIFFT_FLOAT and float64 as FIFFT_DOUBLE, each bit-exact. FIFF has one calibration per channel
 * and no offset, so mne.io.read_raw_fif returns raw * float32(scale * 10^unitExponent) for every channel;
 * a stream with a non-zero offset or digital bits in its words is stored as float64 physical values
 * (raw * scale + offset) with that power of ten as calibration instead. The calibration is that of the
 * stream's metadata when recording starts.
 *
 * Events become annotations (label from AcqStreamInfo::eventLabels, or the code) and, when the stream has
 * no stim channel of its own, the extra stim channel "STI 101" carrying each code for the event's duration.
 * The measurement date is the UTC time of stream sample 0 from the stream's clock model; the device and
 * the clock provenance (clock domain, timebase and lock state, clock source) go into the device info and
 * the description of the measurement info.
 *
 * File layout: every FIFF data buffer is one block of whole 4 KiB pages, written with aligned direct I/O
 * and flushed before the previous block's end marker is turned into a link to it. A file cut off by a crash
 * or power loss therefore ends at the last complete buffer and reads without warnings. Files are split
 * at AcqRecorderOptions::splitBytes into linked parts named like those of MNE-Python (raw.fif,
 * raw-1.fif, ...; split-01, split-02 for BIDS); annotations are written into the first part on stop().
 *
 * @code
 * auto device = ACQLIB::AcqDevice::open("synthetic://?eeg=32&sfreq=1000");
 * ACQLIB::AcqRecorderOptions options;
 * options.device = device->description();
 * auto recorder = ACQLIB::AcqRecorder::start(device->stream(), "/data/session_raw.fif", options);
 * device->start();
 * // ... acquire ...
 * device->stop();
 * recorder->stop(); // everything committed until now is on disk; mne.io.read_raw_fif reads it
 * @endcode

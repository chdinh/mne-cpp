 * @brief    AcqStream (shared handle), AcqWriter (the single producer) and the ring options of a stream.
 *
 * One stream = one rate, one native format, one lock-free single-producer / multi-reader ring
 *. The ring is a power of two in samples, page-aligned, optionally mirror-mapped
 * (the ring's pages mapped twice back to back, so every view is one contiguous part), memory-locked
 * and pre-faulted, or an adopted external buffer such as a device DMA region.
 *
 * Input stream: the backend owns the writer; commit() is one release store and never waits; samples
 * are overwritten whether or not readers consumed them, and slow readers learn the exact loss.
 * Output stream: the application takes the writer with AcqStream::writer(); beginWrite() waits for
 * space freed by the device's gating reader, so unplayed samples are never overwritten. A block whose
 * scheduled start the device has already played as fill is dropped whole and counted in
 * AcqStreamStats::lateCommits; output is never played truncated or shifted in time.
 *
 * Closed-loop output, e.g. a TMS trigger 20 ms after a detected input event and a stimulus waveform:
 * @code
 * auto stim = source->findStream("stim");                          // output stream
 * auto writer = stim.writer();                                      // exclusive
 * const auto at = ACQLIB::mapSample(eeg.clock(), stim.clock(), peakSample) + 20 * stimRate / 1000;
 * writer->pushEvent({.sample = at, .duration = 0, .code = 1});      // device fires at exactly 'at'
 * auto view = writer->beginWrite(pulse.cols, std::chrono::milliseconds(1));
 * ACQLIB::encode(pulse, *view);                                     // physical -> DAC counts, saturating
 * writer->commit(view->sampleCount());
 * @endcode

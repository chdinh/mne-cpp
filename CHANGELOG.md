## [Unreleased]

### For developers

**Breaking changes**

The library interfaces use the C++ standard library instead of Qt for strings,
paths, containers, smart pointers and logging. There are no compatibility
aliases; replace the old spelling as below.

| Before | Now |
|---|---|
| `QString` names, comments and descriptions | `std::string` (UTF-8) |
| `QString` file names, `QFile&` / `QIODevice&` readers | `std::filesystem::path` |
| `QList`, `QVector`, `QStringList`, `QMap`, `QHash` in signatures | `std::vector`, `BASELIB::StringList`, `std::map` |

| `LayoutLoader::readAsaElcFile(path, names, loc3D, loc2D, unit)` | `LayoutLoader::read_elc(path)` → `std::optional<ElectrodeLayout>` (`names`, `positions_3d`, `positions_2d`, `unit`); `parse_elc(text)` |

| `PythonRunner::runCode`, `isPackageAvailable`, `ensureVenv`, ...; `result.stdOut`, `exitCode`, ...; `config.pythonExe`, `timeoutMsec`, `extraEnv` (`KEY=VALUE` list), ... | `run_code`, `is_package_available`, `ensure_venv`, ...; `std_out`, `exit_code`, ...; `python_exe`, `timeout` (`std::chrono`), `extra_env` (map), ... |
| `PythonTestHelper::evalDouble(code, &ok)`, `evalVector`, `evalMatrix`, `evalMatrixViaFile` | `eval_double(code)` etc., returning `std::optional` |
| `PythonTestHelper::writeMatrix`, `readMatrix` | `MATHLIB::write_matrix`, `MATHLIB::read_matrix` |
| `PythonRunner` signals `lineReceived`, `progressUpdated`, `finished` | the line and progress callbacks; `PythonRunner` is no longer a `QObject` |
| `MLTrainer::checkPrerequisites(QStringList)`, `InvCMNE::trainLstm(QString...)` | `check_prerequisites(StringList)`, `train_lstm(std::filesystem::path...)` |
| `utils/report.h`, `UTILSLIB::Report` (`QString`, `QList<QPair>`); `addText`, `addTable`, `addKeyValue`, `addCode`, `sectionCount`, `toHtml`; `ReportSection` | `report/report.h`, `REPORTLIB::Report` (`std::string`, `std::vector<std::pair>`), in the new Qt-free `mne_report` library; `add_text`, ..., `to_html`; the section type is private |
| `utils/generics/observerpattern.h`, `commandpattern.h`, `UTILSLIB::Subject`, `IObserver`, `ICommand` | removed from the libraries; `mne_rt_server` keeps them for its commands |
| `Subject::t_Observers` (`QSet`), `observerNumDebug()`, the global `Subject::notifyEnabled` | `observers()` (`std::vector`, attach order), `observers().size()`, per-subject `set_notify_enabled()` |
| `ex_utils` | `ex_channels`; the other sections moved to `ex_base`, `ex_math`, `ex_pybridge`, `ex_report` and `ex_com` |
| `UTILSLIB::KMeans`, `Linalg`, `Numerics`, `SimplexAlgorithm`, `Spectral`, `Sphere`, `Warp` (in `math/`) | `MATHLIB::...` |
| `UTILSLIB::` and `RTPROCESSINGLIB::` names in `dsp/` (`FilterKernel`, `ICA`, `RtAveraging`, ...) | `DSPLIB::...` |
| `mne_utils`, `utils/utils_global.h`, `UTILSLIB::buildDateTime()` | removed: link the library you use; build stamps come from each library's `<NS>::buildDateTime()` |
| `utils/generics/circularbuffer.h`, `CircularBuffer_Matrix_double` | `base/circular_buffer.h`, `BASELIB::CircularBuffer<Eigen::MatrixXd>` |
| `CircularBuffer::push(ptr, n)`, `getFreeElementsRead()`, `pause()` | `push(std::span)`, `size()`; `pause` is removed |
| `MNE_LOG_LEVEL=FATAL` | removed; `CRIT` is the highest level |
| `ACQLIB::PolhemusConnection`, `PolhemusSerialConfig`, `FastrakParser`, `FastrakSample` (Qt SerialPort) | `AcqDevice::open("polhemus://<port>?stations=1,2")`: a stream of positions and quaternions per station, stylus button presses as event code 1 |
| `PolhemusCoregistration::setConnection(conn)`, `connection()` | feed the stream: `on_pose(station, position, orientation)`, `on_button(station, position, orientation)` |
| `com/rt_client/`: `COMLIB::RtClient`, `RtCmdClient`, `RtDataClient`, `MetaData` (Qt Network) | `AcqDevice::open("rtserver://host:4217?simfile=...&buffer=...")`: the measurement info as `fiff.MeasInfo/1` extension (`toFiffInfo()`), calibrated samples, `STI 014` changes as events |
| `com/rt_command/`: `COMLIB::Command`, `CommandManager`, `CommandParser`, `RawCommand`, `Subject`, `IObserver`, `ICommand` | removed from the libraries: the command vocabulary of `mne_rt_server` lives in its `rtserver_connector` (`RTSERVER::...`); clients send commands through `rtserver://` |

- FIFF channel names are read as stored: `"MEG 0113"`, `"STI 014"`, as in
  MNE-Python and MNE-C. They used to lose their spaces (`"MEG0113"`). Look-ups
  match the way MNE-C does, ignoring spaces and case, so files that spell a
  channel differently still combine (for example a forward solution written
  with `"MEG0113"` and a raw file with `"MEG 0113"`). Compare names with
  `FIFFLIB::same_channel(a, b)` and find them with
  `FIFFLIB::channel_index(names, name)` or `has_channel` (`fiff_ch_name.h`)
  instead of `==`, `BASELIB::indexOf` or stripping spaces.
- `mne_utils` is gone. Its contents moved to `mne_base`, `mne_math`,
  `mne_channels`, `mne_pybridge`, `mne_report` and `mne_com`, so each library
  has one purpose and one namespace.
- `mne_base` is the new lowest library: logging, error results, byte streams,
  string and path helpers, the thread pool and the circular buffer. It depends
  on the standard library, zlib and Qt Core only, so `mne_lsl` logs through it.
- `MNE_LOG_LEVEL` now sets the initial `Log::level()`; it can be changed at
  run time with `Log::set_level`, and messages below it are not formatted.
- `MATHLIB::write_matrix` accepts any dense Eigen expression and writes the
  shortest text that reads back bit-identical (it used to round to 6 digits).
  `read_matrix` is locale-independent, reads `nan`/`inf`, and fails instead of
  crashing on ragged rows, non-numeric values or a fixed-size target that does
  not fit.
- `PythonTestHelper::eval` and `run_script` honour their timeout; it used to be
  ignored. `PythonRunner` installs venv packages with `python -m pip`, and
  `MATHLIB::read_matrix` also reads from a `std::istream`.
- `Report` embeds figures (`add_image`, `add_image_file` for PNG, JPEG and SVG)
  as base64 data, so the page stays one self-contained file, and links its
  sections from a table of contents. It escapes single quotes too, and its
  footer shows the generation time in UTC.
- `mne_channels` no longer depends on Qt; the standard_1005 table is compiled
  in. `LayoutLoader` also reads MNE-Python's `.elc` layout (plain coordinates,
  one label per line) and Windows line ends, and fails on malformed numbers
  instead of reading them as zero. `SelectionIO::write_mon` refuses group names
  that would leave the target directory.
- `ex_make_layout` honours `--mirrorY`; it used to mirror x twice.
- New `mne_acq_devices` library with the `brainamp://` source for Brain
  Products BrainAmp amplifiers. `brainamp://?simulate=1` emits the amplifier's
  int16 wire format from `synthetic://` signals, so it runs without hardware
  on every platform; on Windows the source talks to the BrainAmp driver when
  `BrainAmpIoCtl.h` is in `MNE_BRAINAMP_SDK_DIR`.
- The BrainAmp MNE Scan plugin reads through `brainamp://` and is built by
  default; its setup has a simulate switch, the channel count and the
  resolution. It delivers the amplifier's native 5 kHz instead of dropping
  samples to lower rates, which aliased, and the marker channel holds the
  marker codes instead of codes scaled as volts.
- `tmsi://` streams TMSi Refa and Porti amplifiers, with each channel's
  gain, offset and exponent as its scale, and measures their impedances;
  `tmsi://?simulate=1` simulates a Refa on every platform. On Windows it
  loads the TMSi SDK from the system directory only.
- The TMSI MNE Scan plugin reads through `tmsi://` and is built by default,
  with a simulate switch. The impedance view is updated from the GUI thread
  instead of the acquisition thread. Trigger codes are no longer rewritten
  for display (254, 253 and 252 became 4000, 8000 and 2000 in recordings),
  the placeholder projectors (all-ones vectors named PCA-v1 to PCA-v3) are
  gone, and the beep interval starts at 5 s instead of an uninitialised
  value. The samples always apply the channels' gain, offset and exponent;
  the options to skip them and the driver debug file are removed.
- `gusbamp://` streams up to four synchronised g.tec g.USBamp amplifiers,
  the master's inputs first, as floats in microvolts, with the master's
  trigger line and the electrode impedances. `gusbamp://?simulate=1`
  simulates them on every platform. On Windows it loads `gUSBamp.dll` from
  the system directory, so the g.tec header and import libraries are no
  longer needed to build.
- The GUSBAmp MNE Scan plugin reads through `gusbamp://` and is built by
  default (`WITH_GUSBAMP` is gone). It used to dereference a measurement
  info it never created on start, ignore the chosen sampling rate (its slot
  matched no Qt 6 signal) and print every sample. Its setup takes the serial
  numbers and inputs as text, the block size, the trigger line and a
  simulate switch; the empty project dialog is removed.
- `eego://` streams ANT Neuro eego amplifiers as doubles in volts: the
  referential and bipolar inputs, the trigger input as `STI 014` with its
  changes as events, and the sample counter. It measures impedances and
  checks the rate and input ranges against the amplifier. It loads the eego
  SDK library at run time on Windows and Linux (`sdk=` or
  `MNE_CPP_EEGO_SDK`), so building no longer needs the SDK; it is tested
  against a stand-in SDK library. `eego://?simulate=1` simulates an
  amplifier on every platform.
- The EEGoSports MNE Scan plugin reads through `eego://` and is built by
  default (`WITH_EEGO` is gone), with a simulate switch instead of the driver
  debug file. Its streams no longer carry an `EEG REF` channel that was
  always zero. The impedance view used to stay empty unless MNE Scan was
  started from `bin/` and the cap had no more electrodes than the amplifier
  inputs; it now finds its layouts next to the application and colours the
  measured electrodes.
- `neuromag://` reads Neuromag / MEGIN Vectorview and TRIUX systems from
  their acquisition software, as the Neuromag plugins of `mne_rt_server` and
  MNE Scan did until they were removed in 2020: it registers with the data
  server, takes the buffers from its shared memory or files, and starts and
  stops measurements through the collector. The channels and their
  calibration come from the measurement info, `STI 014` (or `STI101`)
  changes become events. `neuromag://?simulate=1` simulates a system on
  every platform.
- The Neuromag MNE Scan plugin is back and reads through `neuromag://`.
- `polhemus://` reads Polhemus Fastrak and FastSCAN digitizers on a serial
  port without Qt: the positions in metres and orientation quaternions of
  every station, and stylus button presses as events. It sets up the
  stations, the output list and the tracking hemisphere.
  `polhemus://?simulate=1` sweeps a stylus over a head. MNE Align reads its
  digitizer through it; `mne_acq_polhemus` no longer needs Qt SerialPort.
- Channel kinds `Position` and `Orientation` and the unit `Meter` describe
  tracked sensors.
- `ftbuffer://` reads FieldTrip buffer servers without Qt. With the Neuromag
  header of `neuromag2ft` it carries the acquisition's channels, measurement
  info and digitizer points, and `STI 014` changes as events; numeric events
  of the buffer become events. `ftbuffer://?simulate=1` relays a simulated
  Neuromag system. The FtBuffer MNE Scan plugin reads through it; it used to
  treat every sample as float32 whatever the buffer held, call every
  channel MEG without the Neuromag header, and hand on half a second of
  samples at a time.
- `mne_com` is a standard-C++ transports library without Qt: `TcpSocket`
  (connect, read and write with timeouts), `UdpSocket` (receive datagrams)
  and `SerialPort` (raw 8N1, `list_serial_ports()`), each reporting
  `std::error_code`s through `std::expected`. The acquisition devices use it
  for their network and serial connections; `ex_com` shows it.
- `brainflow://<board>` opens any board BrainFlow supports through an
  installed BrainFlow 5, whose `BoardController` library is loaded at run
  time (`library=`, `MNE_CPP_BRAINFLOW_LIB`, `pip install brainflow`, the
  system loader) and never built or shipped with MNE-CPP. The board is a
  BrainFlow id or name, the parameters are BrainFlow's input parameters.
  Every row is a channel in BrainFlow's units, the timestamp row is the
  clock and the marker row gives events. Other BrainFlow versions and
  boards this platform's BrainFlow lacks are refused with the reason.
- `streaming_board://<address>:<port>?board=<id or name>` receives what a
  BrainFlow session streams with `add_streamer`, without BrainFlow: the
  channels of `brainflow://`, the sender's markers as events. The layouts of
  the synthetic board, Cyton, Ganglion and Cyton + Daisy are built in,
  generated from BrainFlow by `scripts/acq/generate_brainflow_boards.py`;
  other boards take theirs from an installed BrainFlow. `simulate=1` streams
  a synthetic session to itself. `mne_acq stream --brainflow-multicast`
  sends with the same code and no longer needs Qt Network, and knows the
  same boards without BrainFlow.
- `brainflow_file:///<file>?board=<id or name>` replays a file BrainFlow
  wrote (its file streamer or `DataFilter.write_file`) without BrainFlow,
  paced (`realtime`, `speed`) or as fast as it is read, once or in a
  `loop`; `mne_acq record "brainflow_file://...&realtime=0" out.fif`
  converts it to FIFF with the markers as events.
- `COMLIB::UdpSocket::bind` joins a multicast group given as address,
  sharing its port, on the system's multicast interface and on that of the
  default route, which differ behind a VPN (BrainFlow's streamer sends on
  the first, its receiver listens on the second); `send_to` sends a
  datagram, to a group through the interface of the default route.
- Device URI schemes may contain `_`, as BrainFlow's `streaming_board://`
  does.
- The BrainFlow MNE Scan plugin is back as a client of `brainflow://`: it
  streams any BrainFlow board through an installed BrainFlow, set up by
  board name or id and BrainFlow's input parameters, with every row of the
  board as a channel. It no longer builds BrainFlow as a submodule.
- `mne_acq` offers the device schemes (`brainflow://`, `eego://`,
  `natus://`, ...); it registered only `synthetic://`, `fiff://` and
  `lsl://`. Its BrainFlow output finds BrainFlow through
  `MNE_CPP_BRAINFLOW_LIB`, formerly `MNE_CPP_BRAINFLOW`.
- `babymeg://` reads the acquisition server of a BabyMEG system without Qt:
  its channels, sensor positions, coil types and current gains from the
  command port, the data from the data port, and the trigger lines
  `TRG001` to `TRG008` as a trigger word in `DTRG01` and as events.
  `babymeg://?simulate=1` serves a synthetic session. The BabyMEG MNE Scan
  plugin reads through it and gains host, port and simulation settings; it
  used to connect only to `localhost` and to give every sensor the x
  coordinate as its whole position in the coil transform. Its SQUID control
  dialog, which no button opened, and the `Update Fiff Info` action are
  gone: the gains are read at every start.
- `natus://` receives a Natus Quantum amplifier from the UDP datagrams of
  its streaming machine without Qt, in volts, and stops with a message when
  the machine sends other channels than set. `natus://?simulate=1` streams a
  synthetic session. The Natus MNE Scan plugin reads through it; it used to
  start every block one sample late and drop the samples of the datagram
  that completed a block.
- `rtserver://` reads the active connector of an `mne_rt_server` without Qt:
  it selects the connector, the replayed file and the buffer size, takes the
  measurement info with projectors, compensators and digitizer points, and
  streams the calibrated buffers with `STI 014` changes as events; the end of
  the measurement ends the stream. `rtserver://?simulate=1` replays a
  simulated Neuromag recording. The FiffSimulator MNE Scan plugin reads
  through it; it used to wait a fixed second for its data connection, spin
  on an empty buffer, and need a separate connect step before starting.
- `acq_fiff` maps channel kinds, units and coordinate frames through one
  table shared with the devices that speak FIFF.
- The TMSI impedance view finds its cap layouts wherever MNE Scan was
  started; it stayed empty unless the working directory was `bin/`. With a
  cap of more electrodes than the amplifier measures it colours the measured
  ones instead of none.
- `ACQLIB::start_thread(policy, body)` starts a thread under an
  `AcqThreadPolicy` and returns it, or the error of a refused policy without
  running `body`. Every acquisition backend and the recorder start their
  threads with it.
- `Sphere::fit_sphere_simplex` returns a zero centre when the fit fails; it was
  uninitialised. `LayoutMaker` then projects around the origin, as MNE-C does.
- The export macros of `mne_bids`, `mne_com`, `mne_connectivity`, `mne_dsp`,
  `mne_fiff`, `mne_fs`, `mne_fwd`, `mne_inv`, `mne_lsl`, `mne_mna` and `mne_mne`
  no longer come from Qt. Libraries whose public headers still include Qt
  headers now link Qt publicly, so code using them no longer has to add Qt to
  its own link line.
- `Subject::detach` of an observer that is not attached no longer crashes, and
  observers may detach themselves while they are notified.
- `mne_rt_server` no longer aborts in debug builds when a client requests the
  measurement info: the connector interface `RTSERVER::IConnector` lives in the
  new `rtserver_connector` library, so the server and its plugins share one
  type. Its ids are `FIFF_SIMULATOR_CONNECTOR` and `DEFAULT_CONNECTOR`.
- `RtCmdClient` returns an empty reply when the server closes the connection or
  does not answer within 30 s; it used to spin forever.
- `FiffTag::toInt`, `toJulian`, `toIntMatrix` and `toFloatMatrix` are no longer
  inline.
- The `fiff` headers use `std::int32_t` and the other `<cstdint>` types instead
  of `qint32`, ..., and include no Qt header they do not need (Qt includes in
  public headers 56 -> 13); `fiff_long_t` is `std::int64_t`. Their
  `Q_DECLARE_METATYPE` declarations are gone: Qt 6 puts the types into a
  `QVariant` without them. Code that took `QString`, `QSharedPointer` or
  `QDebug` from a `fiff` header includes them itself.
- `FiffCov` and `FiffNamedMatrix` are plain value types; their `SDPtr`
  aliases and `QSharedData` base are gone. `FiffProj::data`,
  `FiffCtfComp::data`, `MNEForwardSolution::sol`/`sol_grad` and the
  `MNEInverseOperator` matrices and covariances (`eigen_leads`,
  `eigen_fields`, `noise_cov`, `source_cov`, `orient_prior`, `depth_prior`,
  `fmri_prior`) are members, not shared pointers, and compare by value.
  Migration: `x.sol->data` becomes `x.sol.data`, `*x.noise_cov.data()`
  becomes `x.noise_cov`, a null check `if (x.sol)` becomes
  `if (!x.sol.empty())`, and `FiffCov::SDPtr(new FiffCov(c))` becomes `c`.
  `SCMEASLIB::RealTimeFwdSolution` loses `setSol`, `getSol`, `setSolGrad`
  and `getSolGrad` (`setSolGrad` overwrote `sol`); use `getValue()->sol`.
- `FiffStream`, `FiffIO` and `DSPLIB::filterFile` take a
  `std::filesystem::path` or a `BASELIB::ByteStream` instead of a `QIODevice`;
  `fiff_stream.h` and `fiff_io.h` no longer include Qt. `FiffStream(path)`
  reads a file, `FiffStream(std::make_unique<BASELIB::MemoryByteStream>(bytes))`
  bytes in memory; `start_file` and `open_update` take a path (or bytes for
  `start_file`), `open()` takes no mode, and `byte_stream()` replaces
  `device()`. `FiffStream(QByteArray*, mode)` and `FiffStream::byteStream` are
  gone. `FiffIO` reads paths or bytes, its lists are `raw` and `evoked`
  (were `m_qlistRaw`, `m_qlistEvoked`), it is no longer a `QObject`, and
  `write(path, FIFFB_EVOKED)` now writes the evoked sets instead of nothing.
  Migration: `QFile f(name); FiffStream s(&f);` becomes
  `FiffStream s(name.toStdU16String());`, and
  `start_writing_raw(FiffStream::byteStream(file, QIODevice::WriteOnly), ...)`
  becomes `start_writing_raw(file.fileName().toStdU16String(), ...)`.
  `BASELIB::FileByteStream::resize` cuts or extends a file.
- `FIFFLIB::FiffFileSharer` is a plain class without Qt and no longer watches
  its directory: `copy_realtime_file(path)` shares a recording and returns
  the shared file (or an `Io` error), `new_files()` lists the files shared
  since the last call, and `clear()` empties the directory. A shared file
  only appears under its name once it is complete. Migration: replace
  `copyRealtimeFile` with `copy_realtime_file`, and `initWatcher()` plus the
  `newFileAtPath` signal with `clear()`, a `QFileSystemWatcher` on
  `directory()`, and `new_files()` in its `directoryChanged` handler.
  The fiff library no longer runs moc.
- `FiffTag` is no longer a `QByteArray`: it holds its payload in a
  `std::vector<std::byte>`, with `data()` (now `std::byte*`), `size()`
  (`std::size_t`), `empty()`, `resize()`, `bytes()` (a `std::span`) and
  `assign(span)`. `fiff_tag.h` no longer includes Qt. Migration:
  `tag.append(ptr, n)` becomes `tag.assign(std::as_bytes(std::span(values)))`,
  `tag.left(n)` becomes `tag.bytes().first(n)`, `*a == *b` becomes
  `std::ranges::equal(a->bytes(), b->bytes())`, `QString(tag.data())` becomes
  `QString::fromStdString(tag.toString())`, and `char* p = tag.data()` becomes
  `std::byte* p = tag.data()`.
- `FiffTag`, `FiffStream` and the FIFF record types use snake_case member
  names, without aliases. Migration on `FiffTag`: `getType` -> `data_type`,
  `isMatrix` -> `is_matrix`, `getMatrixCoding` -> `matrix_coding`,
  `getMatrixDimensions` -> `matrix_dimensions`, `getInfo` -> `info`, and every
  decoder `toXxx` -> `to_xxx` (`toInt` -> `to_int`, `toFloatMatrix` ->
  `to_float_matrix`, `toSparseFloatMatrix` -> `to_sparse_float_matrix`,
  `toFiffID` -> `to_fiff_id`, `toChInfo` -> `to_ch_info`, `toDauPack16` ->
  `to_dau_pack16`, ...). On `FiffStream`: `isOpen` -> `is_open`,
  `streamName` -> `stream_name`, `setLittleEndian`/`isLittleEndian` ->
  `set_little_endian`/`is_little_endian`, `copyProcessingHistory` ->
  `copy_processing_history`, `seekTo` -> `seek`, `seekToEnd` -> `seek_to_end`,
  `readRaw`/`writeRaw` -> `read_raw`/`write_raw`. `storageSize()` of `FiffTag`,
  `FiffId`, `FiffTime`, `FiffChInfo`, `FiffChPos`, `FiffDigPoint`,
  `FiffDirEntry` and `FiffDataRef` is `storage_size()`, and `FiffId::toString`
  is `to_string`.
- The average colour and activation maps of `AverageSelectionView`,
  `AverageLayoutView`, `ButterflyView`, `EvokedSetModel` and `AverageScene`
  (`getAverageColor`, `setAverageColor`, `newAverageColorMap`, ...) are
  `std::shared_ptr<QMap<...>>` instead of `QSharedPointer<QMap<...>>`.
  Migration: `QSharedPointer<QMap<QString, QColor>>::create()` becomes
  `std::make_shared<QMap<QString, QColor>>()`. The `mne` and `inv` headers
  no longer include `<QSharedPointer>`, `InvGuessData` takes its guess and
  surface files as `std::filesystem::path`, and `MNEClusterInfo` uses
  `std::int32_t` instead of `qint32`.
- `MNERawData::pick_data`, `pick_data_proj` and `pick_data_filt` fill an
  `Eigen::Ref<MNERawData::RowMajorMatrixXf>` (channels x samples) instead of a
  `float**` of caller-built row pointers plus a sample count; the number of
  samples is the number of columns. A buffer whose row count does not match
  the channel selection is refused with `FAIL` and a warning; it used to be
  written past its end. Migration: `std::vector<float*> rows{...};
  raw.pick_data(sel, first, ns, rows.data())` becomes
  `MNERawData::RowMajorMatrixXf values(nchan, ns); raw.pick_data(sel, first, values)`.
- `MNEMeasDataSet::getValuesFromChannelData` reads a row-major channels x
  samples Eigen matrix and writes an `Eigen::Ref<Eigen::VectorXf>` instead of
  taking `float** data, int nsamp, int nch` and a `float*` output. An output
  vector without one element per channel is refused with -1 and a warning.
  Migration: `getValuesFromChannelData(t, integ, rows, ns, nch, tmin, sfreq,
  abs, out)` becomes `getValuesFromChannelData(t, integ, values, tmin, sfreq,
  abs, out)`, with `values` a `MNERawData::RowMajorMatrixXf` and `out` an
  `Eigen::VectorXf(nch)`.
- `MNEMeasDataSet::getValuesAtTime(time, integ, use_abs, value)` writes an
  `Eigen::Ref<Eigen::VectorXf>` instead of taking a channel count and a
  `float*`; it picks the first `value.size()` channels and refuses a vector
  longer than the data has channels, which used to be read past its end.
  Migration: `ds.getValuesAtTime(t, integ, nch, abs, out.data())` becomes
  `ds.getValuesAtTime(t, integ, abs, out)` with `out` an
  `Eigen::VectorXf(nch)`.
- `MNERawData::nbad`, `MNEMeasData::nbad` and `MNECovMatrix::nbad` are gone;
  they duplicated the size of `badlist` / `bads`. Migration: use
  `badlist.size()` (`bads.size()` for the covariance). Raw files read their
  bad channels through `FiffStream::read_bad_channels` on the already open
  stream instead of reopening the file, and the bad-channel names are logged
  on the same line as the count instead of one log message per name.
- `MNERawInfo::ndir` is gone; it always equalled `rawDir.size()`. Migration:
  use `rawDir.size()`.
- `MNEProjOp` and `MNEProjItem` take channel lists as `std::span` instead of a
  list plus a count, `MNEProjItem::affect` returns `bool`, and `MNEProjOp`
  loses `nitems` and `nch` (use `items.size()` and `names.size()`).
  `assign_channels` returns nothing. `makeProjection(files, chs, nch, result)`
  is `make_projection(files, chs)` and returns
  `BASELIB::Expected<std::unique_ptr<MNEProjOp>>`: nullptr when the projection
  would not affect the channels, an `Io` error for an unreadable file.
  Migration: `op.affect(list, n)` becomes `op.affect(list)` (or
  `op.affect(std::span(list).first(n))` for a prefix);
  `MNEProjOp::makeProjection(files, chs, nch, proj)` becomes
  `auto proj = MNEProjOp::make_projection(files, chs)`.
- `MNEProjOp::add_item` takes the vectors by reference and an optional
  `is_active` (was `add_item_active`); `combine` takes a `const MNEProjOp&` and
  returns nothing; `make_proj(bad = {})` replaces `make_proj_bad`;
  `make_proj`, `project_vector`, `project_dvector` and `apply_cov` return
  `bool` instead of `OK`/`FAIL` and are `[[nodiscard]]`; the projections are
  `const`, and `apply_cov` takes the covariance by reference. Migration:
  `op.add_item_active(&m, kind, desc, a)` becomes `op.add_item(m, kind, desc, a)`,
  `op.combine(&other)` becomes `op.combine(other)`,
  `op.make_proj_bad(bad) == FAIL` becomes `!op.make_proj(bad)`.
- `MNEProjItem::vecs` is an `MNENamedMatrix` value instead of a
  `std::unique_ptr`, and `MNEProjItem::nvec` is the function `nvec()`
  (`vecs.nrow`) instead of a second copy of the count. `MNENamedMatrix` and
  `MNEProjItem` no longer declare their own copy constructors and destructors,
  so both are cheap to move. Migration: `item.vecs->data` becomes
  `item.vecs.data`, `item.nvec` becomes `item.nvec()`.
- `MNENamedVector::pick(names, require_all, res)` takes the names as a
  `std::span` instead of a list plus a count and returns `[[nodiscard]] bool`
  instead of `OK`/`FAIL`. A result vector that does not hold one value per
  name is refused; it used to be written past its end. `MNENamedVector::nvec`
  is gone (use `names.size()`), and the header no longer includes
  `QStringList`. Migration: `vec.pick(names, n, all, res) == FAIL` becomes
  `!vec.pick(names, all, res)`.
- `MNECovMatrix::pick_chs_omit(names, omit_meg_eeg, chs = {})` takes the names
  and channel infos as `std::span` instead of a list plus a count, and
  `omit_meg_eeg` as `bool`. Fewer channel infos than names are refused; they
  used to be read past their end. `mne_cov_matrix.h` no longer includes
  `QStringList`. Migration: `cov.pick_chs_omit(names, n, omit, chs)` becomes
  `cov.pick_chs_omit(names, omit, chs)` (or `std::span(names).first(n)`).
- `MNENamedMatrix::nrow` and `ncol` are the functions `nrow()` and `ncol()`
  (the dimensions of `data`) instead of separately stored counts that could
  disagree with it. `build(rowlist, collist, data)` drops the count
  arguments and refuses name lists that do not fit the data, and
  `pick(rows, cols)` takes the names as `std::span` without counts.
  `MNEProjOp::read` refuses a projection item whose stored vectors do not
  match its vector and channel counts. Migration: `m.nrow` becomes
  `m.nrow()`, `MNENamedMatrix::build(r, c, rows, cols, data)` becomes
  `MNENamedMatrix::build(rows, cols, data)`, `m.pick(rows, nr, cols, nc)`
  becomes `m.pick(rows, cols)`.
- `MNESparseNamedMatrix::nrow` and `ncol` are the functions `nrow()` and
  `ncol()` (the dimensions of `data`), and `data` is a `FiffSparseMatrix`
  value instead of a `std::unique_ptr`, so copying an `MNEDeriv` copies its
  derivation matrix without hand-written cloning. `mne_sparse_named_matrix.h`
  no longer includes `QStringList`. Migration: `m.nrow` becomes `m.nrow()`,
  `m.data->eigen()` becomes `m.data.eigen()`; drop assignments to the counts.
- `InvSourceEstimateIO::writeCsv`, `readCsv` and `writeMatrix` are
  `write_csv`, `read_csv` and `write_matrix`, take a `std::filesystem::path`
  and use the standard library instead of `QFile`/`QTextStream`. Values are
  written in the shortest form that reads back exactly (they were rounded to
  9 digits), and `read_csv` returns an empty estimate for a row that is not
  a number or lacks values (such rows used to be skipped silently, shifting
  the time axis). The write functions are `[[nodiscard]]`. Migration:
  `writeCsv(stc, qpath)` becomes `write_csv(stc, qpath.toStdU16String())`.
- `InvEcdSet::read_dipoles_dip` reads `.dip` files written by
  `mne.Dipole.save`: it read none of their dipoles because they carry extra
  `khi^2` and `free` columns, which are now read into `khi2` and `nfree`.
  Data lines need no leading blank, and a malformed line yields an empty
  set instead of being skipped. `save_dipoles_bdip` writes the record's
  `end` time and zeros in the error-analysis fields it does not compute
  (they held whatever was in memory) and is `const`. The three functions
  take a `std::filesystem::path` and use the standard library instead of
  `QFile`/`QTextStream`; the save functions are `[[nodiscard]]`.
  Migration: pass `qpath.toStdU16String()`.
- New `MNEChSelection::these(name, channels)` and
  `MNEChSelection::assign_channels(chs, deriv = nullptr)` (MNE-C
  `mne_ch_selection_these`, `mne_ch_selection_assign_chs` and
  `mne_ch_selection_assign_chs_info`) build a channel selection and match it
  to a recording; they were private helpers of the dipole fit. The retry
  that matches a channel by the part of its name before a dash (`EEG 001`
  for `EEG 001-REF`) compared the whole name again and never matched; it now
  matches like MNE-C. `mne_ch_selection.h` no longer includes `QString`.
- `MNEChSelection::ndef` is gone (use `chdef.size()`), and `nchan` is the
  function `nchan()` returning `chspick.size()` instead of a count kept next
  to the picked names. Migration: `sel.nchan` becomes `sel.nchan()`; a
  selection built by hand sets `chspick` (and `pick`) instead of `nchan`.
- `MNEChSelection::nderiv` is the function `nderiv()` counting the entries of
  `pick_deriv` that pick a derivation. A selection built by hand used to read
  no derived channels unless it also set the count. Migration: `sel.nderiv`
  becomes `sel.nderiv()`; drop assignments to it.
- `mne/mne_types.h` holds only the MNE-C constants and no longer includes
  20 other headers (fiff stream, projection, covariance, CTF compensation,
  layout, events, filter, ...) and `<QStringList>`. `MNE_DEFAULT_TRIGGER_CH`
  is a `std::string_view` and `MNE_ENV_TRIGGER_CH` a `const char*` constant
  instead of macros; the unused `MNE_ENV_ROOT` is gone. Migration: include
  the headers you use (for example `mne/mne_proj_op.h`) yourself.
- `MNEMshDisplaySurface` loses `user_data` and `user_data_free`, and
  `mne_types.h` loses `mneUserFreeFunc`: MNE-C's `mne_analyze` cached a contour
  map there, nothing in mne-cpp set them. Migration: keep per-surface state in
  your own map keyed by the surface.
- A default-constructed `MNEMshLight`, `MNEMshPicked` or `MNEMshColorScaleDef`
  is zero-initialised (light off at the origin, vertex 0, empty scale); their
  members used to hold whatever was in memory. The `MNEMshLight` constructor
  takes `state` as a `bool`.
- `MNEProjOp` tells MEG, EEG and stimulus channels apart by the name prefix
  (`MEG...`, `EEG...`, `STI...`) like MNE-C. It used to match the text anywhere
  in the name, so a projector zeroed its weights on channels such as `REF_EEG`
  or `TRIG_STI` and could classify an item as EEG.
- `InvDipoleFitData::print_fields` writes to a `std::ostream` instead of a
  `QTextStream`; `inv_dipole_fit_data.h` no longer includes Qt's text stream.
- `MNESourceSpace::filter_source_spaces` writes the omitted points to a
  `std::ostream`, one `%10.3f %10.3f %10.3f` line per point like MNE-C (the
  `--mindistout` file of the forward solution padded its separators too). With
  threads, both source spaces wrote to the stream at once and their lines could
  interleave; each now logs into its own buffer, so the file matches a serial
  run.
- `MNEProjOp::report`, `MNEProjOp::report_data` and `MNESssData::print` write
  to a `std::ostream` instead of a `QTextStream` and print exactly what MNE-C
  prints (`%-10s` channel names, `%10.5g` weights). The library logs these
  reports through `BASELIB::Log` instead of writing to `stderr`. Migration:
  `QTextStream s(&str); op.report(s, tag);` becomes
  `std::ostringstream s; op.report(s, tag);`.
- `mne_doc_shots` no longer captures a window before its pending timers have
  run: when grabbing a frame was slower than the settle time, a repaint that
  fell due during the grab was skipped, so screenshots on a loaded machine
  could show an earlier state and differ between runs.
- `MNEMeasData` and `MNERawData` find the trigger channel (`STI 014` or
  `MNE_TRIGGER_CH_NAME`) with `FIFFLIB::same_channel`, like every other
  channel lookup: spaces and case are ignored.
- `FiffStream::read_rt_tag` is gone: nothing called it, and the real-time
  server reads its socket with `read_tag_info(false)` and `read_tag_data`.
- `fiff/fiff.h`, `connectivity/connectivity.h` and `mne/mne.h` are umbrella
  headers for their library.
- `lsl://?simulate=1` publishes a synthetic EEG session as an LSL stream
  (`channels=`, `sfreq=`, `seed=`) and reads it, through liblsl or the in-tree
  LSL. It used to fail for want of a stream.
- `ChannelDataView` draws magnetometers at their own default scale (1.2 pT);
  they used the gradiometer scale, 33 times larger, so the traces of
  magnetometer systems such as BabyMEG looked flat.
- `mne_fix_stim14` does what MNE-C's tool does: in place, `STI 014` gets the
  range 1 and keeps the low byte of its 16-bit samples; `--32` keeps the low
  16 bits of `STI101` and `STI201`. It used to rebuild `STI 014` from
  `STI 001` to `STI 006` into a copy, with a threshold the calibrated lines
  never reached, and so cleared `STI 014`. A refused file stays unchanged and
  the tool exits with 1. Migration: `mne_fix_stim14 --raw in.fif --out
  out.fif` becomes `cp in.fif out.fif && mne_fix_stim14 out.fif`.
- `mne_toggle_skips` turns skips off and on as MNE-C does, by renaming
  `FIFF_DATA_SKIP` to `FIFF_MNE_DATA_SKIP_NOP` and back. It used to write the
  negated skip count in host byte order, which a skip of one buffer read back
  as -1 and others as garbage.
- The MNE Scan acquisition plugins keep streaming when a block is
  overwritten before they read it (the computer was busy); they used to stop
  for good.
- The raw data browser of MNE Analyze Studio saves samples at their true
  scale; it divided them by the channel range (3276.8 for most channels of
  the sample data).
- `mne_anonymize` writes replacement texts with characters outside ASCII
  whole; it cut each of them short by one byte per such character, leaving
  invalid UTF-8 (a HIS ID `Jörg-Müller-ß` became `Jörg-Müller`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-10-27

**Theme: correctness you can check.** v2.4.0 compares MNE-CPP against
MNE-Python 1.11 wherever both compute the same thing. That comparison found and
fixed more than 20 numerical defects in inverse, forward, beamformer, filtering
and spectral code and more than 200 other bugs. The release adds sEEG/ECoG
support, about 60 new MNE-Python ports, a WebAssembly renderer that matches the
desktop, and a signing pipeline for the Windows and macOS installers. 970
commits since v2.3.0.

This release replaces the v2.4.0 tag of 2026-10-22, which was withdrawn before
its Windows downloads could be signed.

### Highlights

- **Code signing** — every Windows executable and DLL carries a version
  resource with product name MNE-CPP and the release version, checked before
  each SignPath request against the artifact configurations in `.signpath/`.
  The macOS apps, `.dmg` images and installer are Developer ID signed and
  notarized. The Windows downloads of 2.4.0 are not yet Authenticode signed;
  signed Windows builds follow with 2.4.1 once the SignPath certificate is
  issued. The
  [code signing policy](https://mne-cpp.github.io/code-signing-policy/) states
  what is signed, by whom, and what the applications send over the network.
- **Connected documentation** — the manual, API reference and examples link to
  each other by scientific topic; the examples page can be filtered by task,
  recording type, level and library; a new Get Started guide builds a first
  program against an installed MNE-CPP, and every example states what it
  computes.
- **sEEG and ECoG** — new `mne_ieeg` library (implantations, leads, bipolar
  montages, projection of contact values onto the cortex). MNE Inspect draws
  and picks depth and grid electrodes from BIDS `*_electrodes.tsv` and paints
  per-contact values onto the brain, on the desktop and in the browser.
- **Validated against MNE-Python** — about 60 cross-validation test suites
  compare MNE-CPP with MNE-Python 1.11, SciPy, NiBabel and MNE-BIDS on committed
  reference values, from FIFF reading to inverse solutions. A versioned
  inventory lists, for 443 MNE-Python functions, whether MNE-CPP has an
  equivalent, a partial port or nothing yet, with the test that proves it.
- **Inverse and forward results corrected**:
  - Minimum-norm kernels were 0.8 % off.
  - eLORETA was off by a factor of 2 to 4; loose eLORETA was 24 % off.
  - Loose dSPM norms were 17 % off.
  - LCMV/DICS whitening was wrong.
  - The sphere-model forward crashed.
  - Magnetic-dipole fits ended 18 mm off.
  - Details are listed under *Fixed*.
- **File formats corrected**:
  - EDF channels were scaled by 1e6, and BDF was decoded as 16-bit.
  - MNE Browse saved EEG/EOG/STI channels 3276.8 times too large.
  - FIF event files were written scrambled.
  - Raw files with acquisition skips crashed.
  - FIFF writes used host byte order.
- **New MNE-Python ports** — FIR filter design (`create_filter`, `filter_data`,
  `firwin2`), ECG/EOG detection and projectors, Welch, multitaper and Morlet
  PSD/CSD/TFR, muscle and amplitude annotation, EOG regression, permutation
  t-test, `combine_evoked`, `apply_forward`, `compute_proj_evoked`,
  `estimate_snr`, `grade_to_vertices`, `grow_labels`, event utilities and six
  digitizer formats.
- **3D in the browser** — WebAssembly and OpenGL now use the same rendering path
  as the desktop. A long-standing cause of garbled or blank WebGL frames is
  fixed. Source-estimate animation is about twice as fast and picking is about
  1000 times faster.
- **MNE Scan** shows the head-movement path from continuous HPI in 3D.
- **MNE Analyze** gains event durations and trigger codes, averaging per
  condition, and saving of averages.
- **Documentation you can run** — every public class has a compiled, tested
  example (29 new example programs). The API reference has zero Doxygen
  warnings. Manual screenshots are generated by CI from the current build.
- **Trustworthy releases** — signed Windows installers and archives, signed and
  notarized macOS disk images, published SHA-256 checksums, and CI that
  installs MNE-CPP on clean Linux, macOS and Windows machines following the
  build guide.

### New library: `mne_ieeg`

- `IeegImplantation`:
  - Groups contacts into leads.
  - Reads and writes the BIDS iEEG `group` and `dimension` columns.
  - Transforms between coordinate frames.
  - Supports declared lead types (depth, strip, grid).
- `IeegReference` builds bipolar montages along each lead, named as in
  MNE-Python (`LA1-LA2`), as a sparse derivation matrix.
- `IeegSurfaceMap` projects contact values onto the cortex like
  `mne.stc_near_sensors` (sum, single, nearest and weighted modes).
- Example `ex_ieeg`.

### New APIs

**Reading and writing data**
- `FiffExplain` names FIFF tag kinds, block kinds, units, unit multipliers
  and channel kinds; `FiffDirNode::print` writes the block tree to a stream.
- Digitizer readers on `FiffDigPointSet`:
  - Polhemus Isotrak (`.elp`/`.hsp`/`.eeg`) and Polhemus FastSCAN.
  - BrainProducts CapTrak (`.bvct`).
  - EGI MFF.
  - Localite (`.csv`).
  - Neuroscan (`.dat`).
  - `transformToHead`.
- Head → MNI → Talairach transforms (`FiffCoordTransSet::readMniTransform`,
  `headToMni`, `mniToTalairach`); `mne_collect_transforms --mgh`.
- Events (`FiffEvents`): `pick`, `merge`, `count`, `concatenate`,
  `find_stim_steps`, `make_fixed_length`.
- Channels:
  - `channel_indices_by_type`, `pick_channels_regexp` and
    `pick_data_channels`.
  - Every MNE-Python channel type, including seeg, ecog, dbs, fNIRS and eye
    tracking.
- `FiffEvoked::combine` (`combine_evoked`), `FiffEvokedSet::save`,
  `FiffProj::compute_from_evoked`, `FiffCov::read` without exceptions, and
  covariance from epochs already in memory.
- HPI coil frequencies are read from the measurement info.
- MNE-C formats: layouts (`.lout`), event lists, derivations (`MNEDerivSet`),
  and morph maps (`MNEMorphMap`, used by `mne_make_morph_maps`).
- BEM solutions written by MNE-CPP are readable by MNE-C and MNE-Python.

**Source estimation**
- `applyForward`, `estimateSnr`, `MNEForwardSolution::convert_to_surf_ori`
  and `MNESourceSpace::gradeToVertices`.
- `InvSourceEstimate::writeHemispherePair` writes MNE-Python-compatible
  `-lh.stc`/`-rh.stc` files, also for LCMV and DICS results.
- The MNE-C minimum-norm quantities: eigenfield projection, SNR, lambda² and
  predicted data.

**Signal processing and statistics**
- `FirFilter::designMne`, `filterData` and `firwin2`, with window choice.
- `ArtifactDetect`: `computeProjEcg`/`computeProjEog` and `peakFinderMne`.
- `setEegReference` can add an average-reference projector instead of changing
  the data.
- Morlet wavelets (`MorletTfr::buildWavelet`), multitaper TFR on arrays,
  DPSS with `sym`/`lowBias` and concentration ratios, and Welch with DC
  removal.
- Statistics:
  - Permutation t-test.
  - `StatsAdjacency::combine` and `chain`.
  - Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR (`negcorr`) and reject masks.
  - `Numerics::chi2Isf`.
- `FsLabelUtils::growCircularLabel` (`grow_labels`). `KMeans` matches MATLAB
  for start centroids, Hamming distance and empty clusters.

**Workflows (MNA)**
- The graph executor runs verification checks and records provenance:
  versions, host, a SHA-256 hash per input, and timing.
- Parameter expressions support comparisons.

**Display**
- `BrainView`:
  - Electrodes: `setElectrodes`, `setElectrodeValues` and the
    `electrodeContactClicked` signal.
  - `setHeadMovementPath`, `takeScreenshot` and `setAutomatedRotation`.
- `RtFiffRawView` shows a crosshair with the value under the cursor.
  `ChannelDataView::renderToImage` renders traces without a GPU.
- Events carry a duration and a trigger code (`addRangedEvent`,
  `setEventDuration`, `setEventCode`).
- `MNELogger::setLogFile`. Debug and info messages go to stdout; warnings and
  errors go to stderr.

### Applications

**MNE Scan**
- Shows the head-movement path from continuous HPI fitting in the 3D view.
  Coil frequencies are taken from the recording. Digitizer points appear when
  the HPI view opens.
- Writes a log file. Plugin load errors are reported, and `MNE_SCAN_PLUGIN_DIR`
  overrides the plugin location.
- The clustered-MNE plugin is renamed `rtclustmne` and accepts unclustered
  forward solutions.
- Robustness:
  - Survives configurations naming unknown plugins.
  - Plugins stop cleanly before any data arrived.
  - Saving to an unwritable path is reported.
  - The dark theme and font are bundled again.

**MNE Analyze**
- Events have a duration, a trigger code and a type. Ranged annotations are
  drawn as bands, and codes are shared between instances.
- Averaging computes one evoked response per trigger code. *Save average* is
  implemented.
- Opens BEM files under any name and `.dip` dipole files.
- *View ▸ Plugins* menu. Automated 3D rotation works.
- Raw and event export work in the browser build.

**MNE Inspect** (desktop and browser)
- sEEG/ECoG electrodes, *File ▸ Load Electrode Values…*, dipoles placed in
  MRI coordinates.
- View layout and zoom are restored when you reopen a session.

**MNE Analyze Studio**
- Offline mode, a workflow preview, and FIFF files opening in the raw browser
  on Linux.
- Kernel and skill errors are reported instead of failing silently.

**MNE Browse**
- Event markers use the colours chosen for each event type.

**Command-line tools**
- `mne_edf2fiff` converts through the corrected EDF reader.
- `mne_eximia2fiff` works again; every conversion used to fail.
- `mne_prepare_bem_model` and `mne_setup_forward_model` write BEM solutions
  that other tools can read.
- `mne_make_morph_maps` writes real morph maps. `mne_make_derivations` writes
  the MNE-C format.
- `mne_collect_transforms` collects the full transform chain.
  `mne_transform_points` accepts multi-transform files.
- `mne_dipole_fit` honours `--grid`, the guess radius and `--magdip`.
- `mne_process_raw`'s grand average now matches MNE-C.
- Every tool returns a non-zero exit code on failure and writes errors to
  stderr.

**Real-time**
- `mne_rt_server` writes the UTC offset correctly, and the real-time client
  calibrates CTF compensators like the file reader.
- LSL streams are found on the same machine without multicast routing.

### Fixed

**Source estimation**
- Minimum-norm kernels:
  - 0.8 % off: the wrong noise eigenvalues were dropped.
  - eLORETA read its eigenfields transposed (off by a factor of 2 to 4).
  - Fixed-orientation dSPM/sLORETA had an empty noise normalisation.
  - The depth prior summed per channel instead of per source.
- Loose inverses on a Cartesian forward silently became loose = 1 (dSPM norms
  17 % off). Loose eLORETA lacked a renormalisation step (24 % off).
- Fixed-orientation solutions:
  - Forward reads used vertex instead of patch normals (1-2 % error).
  - Inverses built from free-orientation forwards were wrong.
  - `force_fixed` reads overwrote left-hemisphere rows.
- The sample-covariance whitener kept rank 58 of 360. CMNE whitening dropped
  every MEG direction.
- Beamformers:
  - Loading factor wrong.
  - `pick_ori="normal"` gave an empty filter.
  - NAI normalisation and rank handling wrong.
  - The whitener was transposed.
  - Max-power orientation signs were flipped.
  - LCMV used the wrong channels when the evoked channel order differed.
- Label-restricted inverses offset right-hemisphere vertices and kept one
  orientation instead of three.
- Sparse solvers:
  - MxNE stopped 43 % above the optimum.
  - Gamma-MAP pruned too early.
  - TF-MxNE converged short.
  - TRAP-MUSIC missed sources.
  - RAP-MUSIC read out of bounds.
- CMNE re-weighted the wrong quantity.

**Forward modelling and dipole fitting**
- Every sphere-model forward computation crashed.
- MEG/EEG gradients were stored in the wrong matrix.
- Magnetic-dipole fits computed fields at EEG electrodes and fitted current
  dipoles (ending 18 mm off).
- Icosahedron downsampling used the wrong base: only 63 of 2562 vertices
  matched.
- Volume source spaces listed excluded points.
- Volume centre of mass swapped x and z.
- Dipole fit:
  - Skipped or doubled the SSP projection.
  - The baseline used the end time for both bounds.
  - `--grid` and the guess radius were ignored.
  - MNE Analyze defaulted the sphere radius to 0.09 mm.
- On Windows, the Berg-Scherg sphere fit converged to a worse minimum.

**Preprocessing, epochs and averaging**
- SSP vectors from raw data spanned the wrong subspace. Covariance removed the
  grand mean instead of the evoked response, and ignored rejection limits.
- Epochs started one sample early. Baselines dropped the stimulus sample.
- Epoch rejection with a limit for only some channel types (e.g. gradiometers)
  rejected every epoch.
- Averages dropped their last sample, and the real-time average mixed stale
  pre-stimulus data across trigger codes (12 % error).
- Saved filtered raw files were shifted by half the filter length, and trigger
  channels were low-pass filtered with the data.
- SSS swapped its internal and external bases. Fine-calibration files now use
  the Elekta format.
- Spectra:
  - Morlet power was about 88 times too large.
  - PSD/CSD scaling and DC handling were wrong.
  - Real-time noise PSD used |X| instead of |X|².
- The surface Laplacian was centred on the electrodes instead of the head
  sphere.
- Standard montages used invented positions; they now use MNE-Python's
  `standard_1005`.
- Statistics:
  - The one-tailed cluster threshold was wrong.
  - The TFCE grid was wrong.
  - p-value tails below 1e-16 were wrong.
  - FDR ignored `alpha`.
  - Permutation p-values left out the observed statistic.
- Connectivity: correlation did not return Pearson r, and node positions came
  from the wrong channel.

**Files**
- `FiffDirNode::print` split every fragment into its own log line.
- EDF/BDF:
  - Every EDF channel was divided by 1e6.
  - Padded header fields read as 0.
  - BDF was decoded as 16-bit.
  - Channel kinds were wrong.
- BrainVision: unknown units read as zero, channel types were wrong, and ASCII
  files were read as binary.
- BIDS:
  - Electrode positions were attached to the wrong channels.
  - Units were wiped.
  - `recording` was written as `rec`.
  - Run numbers were padded.
  - The digitizer frame was wrong.
- FIFF:
  - Writes used host byte order.
  - UTF-8 strings were truncated.
  - Saving picked channels twice and calibrated evoked data twice.
  - Event files were scrambled.
  - The UTC offset and the inverse source unit were lost.
  - Old-style evoked files could not be read.
  - Corrupt tags were read out of bounds.
  - Files with acquisition skips or no data crashed.
- CTF compensation: the inverse transform was wrong, calibration was
  re-applied on write, and partial reads were returned silently.
- FreeSurfer:
  - Surface normals were overwritten instead of summed (affects
    `mne_surf2bem`).
  - Quad surfaces were scrambled.
  - Curvature or truncated files crashed the reader.
  - Asking for a hemisphere that was not loaded crashed.
- MRI: truncated `.nii.gz` files looped forever, and the Talairach transform
  frames were wrong.

**Applications**
- macOS (Apple silicon): the apps of the dynamic package and the installer were
  killed at launch because packaging invalidated their signatures.
- macOS and Linux dynamic packages: `resources` (layouts, styles, server
  configuration) was a link to the build machine instead of the files.
- macOS packages only started on the build machine's macOS (26); they now
  run on macOS 14.4 and later, the minimum of the bundled Qt.
- MNE Browse:
  - Saved EEG/EOG/STI channels 3276.8 times too large.
  - Could overwrite its own input.
  - Wrote empty annotation and event files.
  - Annotation durations grew on every save.
- MNE Analyze and MNE Scan: the butterfly plot showed an empty (on some screens
  magenta) area instead of the averages, and its screenshots were empty.
- MNE Analyze:
  - Events: event files never opened, trigger detection found no onsets, and
    reselecting a recording discarded its events.
  - Coregistration paired fiducials by position, ran ICP widgets from a
    worker thread, and read weights as 0 in decimal-comma locales.
  - Crashes fixed: adding an average without a recording, jumping to an event
    with nothing selected, channel selection, and a 13 GB allocation from an
    uninitialised pointer.
- MNE Scan:
  - Crashed on shutdown and on unknown plugins.
  - Reported 4294967295 channels before the channel info arrived.
  - Took screenshots of the wrong view.
  - Did not restore scalings.
- The real-time raw view drew markers offset after the buffer wrapped. The
  butterfly view compressed long averages. The spectrum view drew upside
  down. Several settings views lost their values without a settings file, and
  colour dialogs turned items black on *Cancel*.
- 3D view:
  - Thresholded source estimates showed the colormap's zero colour instead of
    the cortex.
  - Real-time sensor colouring never reached the head.
  - Dipoles were about 4 cm off in MRI coordinates.
  - Screenshots were written to `/`.
- Coregistration: the ICP nasion pin pulled exact alignments 25 mm off;
  optical calibration ended 24 mm RMS off.
- `FiffFileSharer` never delivered files (MNE Scan → MNE Analyze hand-over).

### Performance

- Source-estimate animation on two pial surfaces: 4.4 → 1.9 ms per frame.
  Hover highlighting: 10 ms → under 1 µs. Ray picking: 1.6 ms → about 1 µs.
- FIR filtering uses power-of-two FFTs (a test filter went from 13 s to 18 ms).
  The Hilbert envelope is FFT-based instead of O(n²).
- The browser build no longer re-uploads geometry every frame.

### For developers

**Breaking changes**
- Renamed:
  - macOS and Linux deploy with `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh`; `deploy.bat` is
    Windows only.
  - disp3D types live in the `DISP3DLIB` namespace; `PickResult` is now
    `RayHit`.
  - MNE Scan plugin `rtcmne` is now `rtclustmne` (`RtClustMne`).
- Changed defaults:
  - `FiffCoordTrans::read` returns the first transform in a file; use
    `readTransform(from, to)` to choose one.
  - `MNEForwardSolution::read` keeps bad channels by default.
  - `WelchPsd` removes the DC by default, and CSD no longer returns the DC bin.
  - `KMeans` uses the "singleton" empty-cluster action.
  - `StandardMontage` positions are now MNE-Python's.
- Changed values:
  - ECoG/sEEG/DBS channel kinds use the FIFF-standard values 902/802/803.
  - The BIDS entity is written as `recording`.
- Changed signatures:
  - FIFF writers, `checkIntegrity()` and `FiffEvokedSet::compensate_to` return
    `bool`.
  - Ownership-transferring factories return `std::unique_ptr`.
  - `CircularBuffer` cannot be copied.
- Removed:
  - `ElectrodeArray`/`ElectrodeContact`/`ElectrodeLayout` (use
    `IeegImplantation`).
  - `EDFReader` scale factor and `mne_edf2fiff --scaleFactor`.
  - `MNEHemisphere::getTriCoords`.
  - `FiffDirNode::explain`/`explain_block`/`get_tag_explanation`/
    `get_unit_name` and `FiffExplainEntry` (use `FiffExplain`).
  - mne_browse `MnxProject` (use the MNA project container).
  - Several unused internals.
- MNE Scan's bad-channel resource is renamed `babymeg_bad_channels.txt`. The
  MNE Analyze event shared-memory key is versioned.

**Quality**
- Every compiler warning is an error on all platforms, including the
  WebAssembly build.
- The source tree is formatted with clang-format 21.1.8 (one reformat commit,
  ignored by `git blame`), and clang-tidy findings may not grow.
- No raw `new`, `NULL`, C-style casts, `printf` or numeric `#define`s remain.
  Ownership uses smart pointers.
- Tests:
  - 34 tests that had never run in CI now run, and 26 unregistered tests were
    found.
  - Every test is registered with a label and a timeout.
  - Tests run against both the oldest and the newest supported Qt.
- Line coverage: libraries 89 %, applications 56 %, tools 61 %. Library branch
  coverage: 65 %.
- A layering check keeps the libraries free of dependency cycles.

**Build and release**
- Qt 6.10.0 to 6.12.0, Emscripten 6.0.12, ONNX Runtime 1.31.0. Versions are
  kept in `src/external/external_deps.env`.
- `doc/wiki/Release-Process.md` describes:
  - A release-candidate check before every release.
  - Windows Authenticode signing through SignPath, and macOS signing and
    notarization.
  - `SHA256SUMS` with per-file signing status.
  - Verification of the published downloads on all three platforms.
- A weekly onboarding job follows the build guide on clean Linux, macOS and
  Windows machines. It found three setup bugs, fixed in this release.
- `SECURITY.md` added.

### Documentation

- 29 new example programs, compiled and run by CI. Every public class has an
  example snippet in its API page; internal types show the examples that
  exercise them.
- The API reference builds with zero Doxygen warnings (1,726 fixed).
- Manual screenshots are generated from the current build in CI and compared
  against reference images.
- The website build uses a patched `braces` (nesting-depth bound for
  GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm, which upstream has not fixed), `follow-redirects`
  1.16.1 and `launch-editor` 2.14.2.
- The website fails to build on broken links or missing images, and has a
  generated quality page.
- The build guide is complete for all three platforms; CI runs exactly the
  commands it shows.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-28

### Bug Fixes

- **mne_inspect — STC scrolling broken on desktop** (regression introduced in 2.2.0). Scrubbing the STC time-slider froze playback, produced flicker / "stretched-triangle" geometry artefacts, and could crash the application after a few seconds.
  - Root cause: commit `b58c18a8c2` ("Energy/computational savings…") switched the per-surface vertex buffer from `QRhiBuffer::Immutable` to `QRhiBuffer::Dynamic` to enable in-place colour updates. `Dynamic` is documented for *small, frequently-updated* payloads (UBOs, a few hundred bytes); using it for a multi-MB brain-surface VBO triggers two failure modes on Metal/Vulkan:
    1. Each in-flight frame slot keeps its own physical buffer. Skipping the per-frame `updateDynamicBuffer()` (because `m_gpu->dirty` was false) caused the GPU to sample the wrong slot — visible as stuck frames and wildly out-of-range vertex positions.
    2. Allocating a 4-5 MB Dynamic buffer × in-flight slots × every visible surface multiplied GPU memory pressure by roughly 3×, leading to allocation failures during interactive scrubbing.
  - The WebAssembly build was unaffected because the WASM merged-surface renderer uses `Immutable` buffers re-uploaded every frame.
  - Fix: revert just the desktop VBO type to `QRhiBuffer::Immutable` (re-created when vertex data is dirty). All other improvements from `b58c18a8c2` (demand-driven render, cached vertex count, IBO upload gating, removal of redundant `updateBuffers` in `renderSurface`) are kept.
  - Files: `src/libraries/disp3D/renderable/brainsurface.cpp`.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Highlights

- **MNX as MNE Scan project storage** — Pipeline configurations now load and save as `.mna` (JSON) or `.mnx` (CBOR) files via `MnaIO`; legacy XML pipeline format removed. Default auto-save path is `default.mna`.
- **Unified File-menu naming across applications** — `mne_scan`, `mne_inspect`, and `mne_browse` now use the same "Open Project… / Save Project… / Export Project as MNX…" pattern.
- **MNE-C CLI parity (82 tools)** — every command-line tool from MNE-C has a mne-cpp counterpart; final 4 ports landed in this release (`mne_make_movie`, `mne_convert_lspcov`, `mne_convert_ncov`, `mne_dacq_annotator`).
- **Lossless MNA / MNX round-trip** — every MNA struct preserves unknown JSON/CBOR keys via an `extras` field, so newer schema fields survive a round-trip through older software.
- **Performance as a co-equal optimization goal** — periodic `code-optimization` prompt and matching `optimization-requirements.md` doc cover both idiomatic-code refactors and quantitative perf wins (≥ 5 % wall-clock).

### New Features

- **MNA graph-execution library** (`mne_mna`): New library for the `.mna` analysis node-graph format with YAML-based operator definitions, topological execution, and `MnaOpRegistry` for built-in and user-registered operators
- **MNX binary container** — CBOR-based binary equivalent of `.mna` (`MNX1` magic header), with embedded-data support and identical key structure for lossless format conversion
- **MNA Scan integration** — `MnaGraph m_pPipelineGraph` mirrors the live plugin scene in `PluginSceneManager`; `MnaDataKind` ↔ `ConnectorDataType` mapping shipped in `mna_scan_types`; `PluginGui::loadConfig`/`saveConfig` route through `MnaIO::read`/`MnaIO::write`
- **Stream-mode MnaGraphExecutor** — `MnaGraphExecutor::startStream()` / `stopStream()` with `StreamContext` for real-time acquisition pipelines
- **Machine-learning library** (`mne_ml`): New library with `MlTrainer` for sklearn-compatible model training via embedded Python, supporting SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and custom estimators
- **STS covariance estimators**: Added Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle Approximating Shrinkage (OAS) estimators to the `sts` library with cross-validation support against scikit-learn
- **Source-space cluster permutation tests** — `StatsCluster::oneSamplePermutationTest()`, `fTestPermutationTest()`, `tfce()` (threshold-free cluster enhancement); `StatsAdjacency::fromSourceSpaceTemporal()` for spatio-temporal adjacency
- **Spectral connectivity expansion** — `GrangerCausality` (`"GC"`), `DirectedTransferFunction` (`"DTF"`), `PartialDirectedCoherence` (`"PDC"`); shared MVAR fitting via `MvarModel`
- **CMNE sparse inverse**: Added Cascaded MNE (`InvCMNE`) solver to the inverse library for spatially sparse source estimation
- **DSP Infomax ICA**: Extended the `dsp` library with an Infomax-based ICA decomposition algorithm
- **BIDS coordinate system**: Added `BidsCoordinateSystem` class for round-trip parsing and writing of `coordinatesystem.json`, and `BidsElectrode::toFiffDigPoints()` for converting BIDS electrodes to FIFF digitizer point sets

- **MRI slicer**: Added `MriSlicer` class for extracting orthogonal slices (Axial/Sagittal/Coronal) from NIfTI volumes
- **3D electrode visualization**: `ElectrodeObject` now includes QRhi GPU buffer management (`updateBuffers`, `vertexBuffer`, `indexBuffer`, `instanceBuffer`) following the BrainSurface pattern; new `electrode.vert` / `electrode.frag` shaders with instanced contact spheres and Blinn-Phong lighting
- **3D MRI slice visualization**: New `SliceObject` renderable for textured MRI volume slices with voxel-to-world transforms and intensity windowing; new `slice.vert` / `slice.frag` shaders
- **FiffAnnotations integration**: `AnnotationModel` refactored to use `FiffAnnotations` as backing store instead of internal `QVector<AnnotationEntry>`, with `fiffAnnotations()` / `setFiffAnnotations()` public accessors
- **Python cross-validation tests**: Added `GUARD_PYTHON` / `GUARD_PYTHON_PACKAGE` macros ensuring Python-dependent tests fail in CI (`MNE_REQUIRE_PYTHON=true`) instead of silently skipping
- **PythonTestHelper extensions**: Added `writeMatrix()`, `readMatrix()`, and `evalMatrixViaFile()` convenience methods for Eigen↔NumPy round-trip validation
- **MNA Scan plugin registry**: Added `scan-plugins.json` schema and `MnaScanTypes` class for declaring MNE Scan plugins as MNA operator schemas
- **W-file I/O**: Added `read_w` and `write_w` methods to `FiffStream` for FreeSurfer `.w` format surface data
- **Cortical surface mapping**: New `MNECorticalMap` class with `icoDownsample()` for icosahedral downsampling, `smoothOperator()` for nearest-neighbor surface smoothing, and `computeMorphMaps()` for cross-subject cortical morphing
- **Scalp surface generation**: Added `makeScalpSurfaces()` to `MNEBemSurface` for creating decimated scalp meshes at multiple resolutions
- **Processing history**: Added `copyProcessingHistory()` to `FiffStream` for transferring processing provenance between FIFF files

### MNE Inspect

- **WASM compatibility** — menu bar renders inline; `QFileDialog` guarded for WASM; recent-files menu disabled on WASM

### MNE Scan

- **File menu uses Project terminology** — `&New Project` (Ctrl+N), `&Open Project…` (Ctrl+O, accepts `*.mna *.mnx`), `&Save Project…` (Ctrl+S, defaults `.mna`), `&Export Project as MNX…` (Ctrl+Shift+E, always binary CBOR)
- **Auto-save default path** — `default.xml` → `default.mna` (auto-loaded on startup if present)
- **Foreign-data preservation** — round-trip saves preserve unknown fields via `m_loadedMnaProject`
- **Modernised pipeline canvas** — rounded-rect nodes with gradient fills, drop shadows, type labels (`SENSOR` / `ALGORITHM`), centred name, hollow-input / filled-output ports, Bezier connections with tangent arrowheads, dot-grid background, Tailwind-inspired palette, selection glow

### MNE Browse

- **Project reset on standalone open** — opening a raw file without a project resets `m_mnxProject` to prevent stale-project contamination across all 5 file-open entry points (desktop menu, WASM picker, recent files, drag-drop, CLI)

### WASM Progressive Web App

- **PWA manifest + service worker** — `scripts/wasm/manifest.json`, `scripts/wasm/sw.js`, 192×192 / 512×512 icons; offline caching with versioned cache keys; combined COOP/COEP header injection
- **No server required** — deploy bundle to any static host; service worker injects required headers for `SharedArrayBuffer`

### Command-Line Tools

- **Info tools** (6 new): `mne_check_eeg_locations`, `mne_evoked_data_summary`, `mne_list_coil_def`, `mne_list_proj`, `mne_sensor_locations`, `mne_show_mna`
- **Forward tools** (3 new): `mne_fit_sphere_to_surf`, `mne_make_scalp_surfaces`, `mne_transform_points`
- **Conversion tools** (3 new): `mne_convert_ctf_markers`, `mne_epochs2mat`, `mne_mna_bids_converter`

### Breaking Changes

- **Library renames**: `connectivity` → `conn`, `communication` → `com`, `rtprocessing` → `dsp`, `inverse` → `inv`, `disp3D_rhi` → `disp3D`
- **Class renames**: Inverse library classes now use `Inv` prefix (`InvRapMusic`, `InvMinimumNorm`, `InvSourceEstimate`, `InvHpiFit`, …)
- **Moved classes**: `InvInverseOperator`, `InvMeasData`, `InvMeasDataSet` moved from `inv` to `mne` library (as `MNEInverseOperator`, `MNEMeasData`, `MNEMeasDataSet`); backward-compatible forwarding headers provided
- **Moved classes**: `FwdForwardSolution` moved to `MNEForwardSolution` in the `mne` library; forwarding header in `fwd/` for backward compatibility
- **Removed**: `InvCorSourceEstimate` class (superseded by unified `InvSourceEstimate`)
- **Split**: `MNEMath` split into `Linalg` and `Numerics` in the `math` library
- **Moved**: `events` library moved into `mne_analyze` application (no longer a standalone library)
- **Qt requirement**: Qt 6.10.0 minimum (Qt 5 no longer supported)

- **Forward library (fwd)**: Removed ~700 lines of dead code; replaced `printf` → `qInfo`/`qWarning`; replaced `goto` → early return/lambdas; replaced C macros (`ARSINH`, `EPS`) → `constexpr`/`inline`; modernized `FwdBemModel` members from raw pointers to Eigen types and `std::shared_ptr`
- **FIFF I/O consolidation**: Moved duplicated FIFF reading functions to library classes (`FiffStream::read_bad_channels`, `MNECovMatrix::read`, `MNERawInfo::find_meas_info`)
- **Thread safety**: Fixed thread-unsafe `static float*` in `MNEProjOp::project_vector` using `thread_local`
- **Network input validation**: Added bounds checking in BabyMEG client byte conversion functions
- **Sparse matrix crash fix**: Guarded `MNEHemisphere::operator==` against segfault on default-constructed sparse matrices
- **Copyright**: Updated to 2026 across all library headers
- **Qt6 serialization**: Updated `QDataStream` version from `Qt_5_1` to `Qt_6_0` in rt_server
- **Centralized CLI versioning**: All 51 CLI tools now derive their `PROGRAM_VERSION` from the CMake project version (`MNE_CPP_VERSION`) instead of hardcoded strings
- **Format specifier fix**: Fixed `%d` → `%lld` for `qsizetype` in BabyMEG client warnings
